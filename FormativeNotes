==============(Stochastic/deterministic/observable?) + details and explanation as to why **Morgan**===============
Poker is a stochastic game:

-- There are no known algorithms that can be used to predict the outcome of the game.

-- This is because there is a certain amount of randomness as to which card will be drawn.

-- In a perfect scenario the agent will be unable to predict which card will be drawn - this is because they can only see, 
   at a maximum, six cards (in a standard game of texas hold'em, the agent has two cards, and four cards would be visible 
   on the table before the fifth and final card is revealed, and which point randomness is not a factor).

==============Define the problem (state, actions, transition model etc) **Morgan**==============
Using PEAS:

-Performance Measure
-- Another player/agent folding their hand
-- Winning a hand
-- Having more chips than other players/agents
-- Winning the game

-Environment
-- Stochastic
-- Partially observable - we cannot see what cards the other players/agents have and which cards will be drawn
-- Static - the cards that will be drawn and that other players have will not change

-Actuator
-- The only actuators that can be performed are the moves available to a player within poker:
--- Fold
--- Call
--- Check
--- Raise

-Sensors
-- Cards on the table
-- Cards within hand
-- Cards remaining within the deck (based on those on the table)
-- The 'tells' of other players
